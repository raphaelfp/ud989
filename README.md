# ud989 - JavaScript Design Patterns

This is my attempt to code along with Udacity - [JavaScript Design Patterns](http://udacity.com/courses/ud989).

## Who am I?

My name is Raphael, I study Computer Engineering at Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais and I'm a Software Developer Intern at DTI Technologies at the moment.

## Why did I created this repo?

Because I'm want to master my Javascript skills!
I already know a little bit of Javascript, but I didn't had a cool project to tinker with all the cool things Javascript have. I kind of feel frustrated, so I decided to finish all Javascript Udacity's courses.

## The course itself

I'll try to code along with the course and make it so that every commit is a different quiz, with different folders for projects. So every one can track my development, step by step.

## How to run

* Clone the repository
* Run npm install
* Run npm install wepack webpack-dev-server -g
* Run webpack-dev-server --inline --hot
